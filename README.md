## Running
This daily (fairly speaking weekly) life ritual dates back to my high school sophomore, when one of my friend encouraged me run one circle around the field track. The subtle feeling of being able to run longer and longer keeps me on the road. This habit just sticks with me for 5 years. About two years ago, I began using APP to record this reward seeking behavior.  

The accumulated distance now is over 800km. If no accident happens (I definitely expect so), it will grow quickly.
Hopefully, I will get enough passion for a marathon some day before I turn too old (now I am already old being 20 !).
